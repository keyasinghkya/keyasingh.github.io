&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zangezi is a sextet accompanied by a “visual artist&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;sound designer&amp;rdquo; that strives for an artificial but organic sound production aesthetic.&amp;quot; As the visual artist in this sextet, I composed the live-visuals in this piece along with camera support from Hoi Man. Much of the visuals were created with live-camera input along with elements made using footage filmed the day before during our rehearsals. In this work, the visuals mainly played with temporality and multiplicity of the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RMFH was a project led by Finnish artist, Pasi Mäkelä. I initially joined this constellation in the role of support camera and video editor during their first performance which was &lt;a

  &gt;live streamed from Punctum&lt;/a&gt; (Prague, CZ) in December 2020. From the following year, I began creating the live-visuals we used in the show. Conceptually and formally rooted in experiment, this project was really &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; to be a part of. I was able to come in and develop all the live-camera things I wanted to play with. I developed my practise of working with the simplicity of OBS Studio and pushing its limits by building visuals using chroma/luma keying, layering, collaging, multiple camera inputs and multiple projections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
